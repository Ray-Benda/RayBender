            Raymond plans to get a job in the Comuter Science field. He knows that this field is in high demand and that many companies are looking to hire. With Computer Scientists being such a demand, Ray thought it would be best to apply his math and science skills there. So far he has learned so much and enjoys thinking logically.
            With technology growing exponentially, there will always a job for a computer scientist. He plans to use technology to help others around him. Another ambition for Ray is that he see the impact of music on people. Everyone enjoys a certain genre, and music can form bonds with people who have extremely different backgrounds.
            Music is universal and like technology, wont go away for a very long time. With all these great things in his life, Ray plans to live to the fullest while helping those around him.
